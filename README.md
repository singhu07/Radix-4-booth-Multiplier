# Radix-4-booth-Multiplier
Implementation of 4 bit and 8 bit multiplication using Radix-4 multiplier.

##  Overview

This project implements both 4-bit and 8-bit **Radix-4 Booth Multipliers** using Verilog.  
The design is based on a **datapath and controller FSM** architecture, aimed at efficient signed multiplication using the Booth encoding technique.

Both versions simulate the multiplication of signed numbers using the Radix-4 algorithm, reducing the number of partial products and improving performance compared to basic shift-and-add methods.
